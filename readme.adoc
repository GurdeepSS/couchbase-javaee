= Couchbase and Java EE

This workspace will show how to query a Couchbase bucket using simple Java EE application deployed on WildFly. Alternative configuration is also provided to deploy on Payara/GlassFish.

== Minimum Requirements

. Docker for Mac 1.13

== Run Application

. Start Docker Swarm Mode: `docker swarm init`
. Deploy the application: `docker stack deploy --compose-file=docker-compose.yml webapp`

Optionally, you may like to build your own image.

. Build application: `mvn package`. Alternatively, it can be built using Docker:
+
```
docker volume create maven
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/usr/src -v maven:/root/.m2 -w /usr/src maven:3.3-jdk-8 mvn package
```
+
. Build Docker image: `mvn package -Pdocker`
. Push Docker image: `mvn install -Pdocker`

== Deploy Application to Payara/GlassFish

```console
mvn install -Ppayara -Dpayara.hostname=localhost -Dpayara.username=admin -Dpayara.password=glassfish
```
